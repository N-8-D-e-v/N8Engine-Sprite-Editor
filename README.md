# n8sprite
The pixel art sprite editor formerly used to make sprites for my open-source C# game engine, n8engine.

The engine no longer uses the n8sprite file format, so this is now useless and depricated, but feel free to do whatever you want with it.

If you plan to clone the repo then make sure to add DOTween (http://dotween.demigiant.com/) and TextMeshPro to the plugins folder.
